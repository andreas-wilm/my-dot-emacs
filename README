My dot.emacs. 

Previously posted on my website and found useful by others. Therefore
made public here, but mainly used by myself for syncing accross
machines. Setup biased towards GUI-usage on Mac (emacs-app) and
CLI-only usage on Linux.

Files in my_yasnippets have to be linked to in yasnippet dir.
